# Description

This repository holds a few basic snippets to be used with Yasnippet on GNU/Emacs while writing models to be used by DBT.

The models are expressed either as SQL statements or YaML files where tests on columns can be expressed.


The content of this repository should be placed in the following directory:

```
$(HOME)/.emacs.d/private

```

Content of the `snippets` directory should automatically be loaded when Yasnippet loads.
